# Expression_string_int
For example, MyInteger m1=5; This statement looks like defining a variable, and that is exactly what the program has to do. Read the text statements from user one at a time and do what the user has instructed.  For instance, user types in the following.  First line : MyInteger m1=5;MyInteger m2=7; Second line: m1+m2  Here the first line contains two statements separated by a semicolon. If there is a semicolon, treat it as a statement and create the variable. So here are two statements and you have to create two class objects after reading this. In the second line, there is no semicolon, that means its an expression. You have to evaluate the expression using the data user has provided in the previous statements and print the result.  Some examples of input and output.  Input:  Line 1: MyString str1 = "rahul"; Line 2: MyString str2 = "tr"; Line 3: str1 + str2 Output : rahultr Line 4: str1 Output : rahul  Line 5: MyInteger int1 = 5 Line 6: str1+int1 Output: Error. Datatype mismatch.  Line 6: MyInteger m1=5;MyInteger m2=10;MyInteger m3=5;MyInteger m4=3; Line 7: m1+(m2-m4)*m2 Output: 15
